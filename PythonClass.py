# Arithmetic Operators
# These are the same arithmetic operators we have in maths we can add, substract, multiply, divide

# Operator Precedence
# It is the order of arithmetic operations
# x = 10 + 3 * 2
# print(x)

# Order of operator precedence
# Exponentiation 2 ** 3
# Multiplication or division
# Addition or Substraction

# x = (10 + 5) * 20 - 3
# print(x)

# Math Operations
# abs function returns a positive number, it changes the sign of a negative number
# Python math module contains usable functions to use for complex calculations

# Example
# import math
# print(math.floor

# If Statements
# These statements are based on some conditions


# Price of the house if it has good credit cost is 1 million

# price = 1000000
# good_credit = True
# if good_credit:
#    down_payment = 0.1 * price
# else:
#     down_payment = 0.2 * price
# print(f"Down Payment will be ${down_payment}")

# Check which is greater

# a = input("Enter your first number - ")
# b = input("Enter your Second Number - ")

# if a > b:
#     print(f"{a} is a greater number")
# elif b > a:
#     print(f"{b} is a greater number")
# elif a==b:
#    print("Neither is bigger")

# Logical Operators
# we use logical operators when we have multiple conditions
# with LOGICAL AND: operator both conditions should be true
# with LOGICAL OR: operator only of the condition should be true
# NOT: LOGICAL Operator inverses any boolean value given (It will convert true or false)

# Comparison Operators
# We use comparison operators when we need to compare a variable with a value

# fill_name = input("Enter your Full name - ")
# loc_name = input("Enter your location - ")

# if len(fill_name) > 30 and len(loc_name) > 30:
#     print("Your Name and location is too long")
# elif len(fill_name) <= 2 and len(loc_name) <= 2:
#     print("Your name and location is too small")
# else:
#     print("Your name and location is fine")
